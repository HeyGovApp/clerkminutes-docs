### Overview

ClerkMinutes allows you to collaborate with speakers, presenters, and other stakeholders when building your meeting agenda. You can request files and documents for specific agenda items directly from the people involved.

This is useful when you need supporting documents, presentations, or other attachments for an agenda item, but the files are held by someone else (e.g., a department head or presenter).

### Request files for an agenda item

You can request files from a person in your jurisdiction for any agenda item. The person you specify will be notified via email (and text, if their phone number is on file) with a secure link to upload files directly to the agenda item.

#### Steps to request files

1. Open the meeting and navigate to the **Agenda** tab
2. Click on the agenda item you want to request files for to open the **Edit agenda item** modal
3. In the **Attachments** section, click the **Request files** button next to **Upload file**
4. The agenda item is automatically saved when you click **Request files**
5. In the **Request files** modal, you will see:
   - The title of the agenda item in the modal header (e.g., "Request files for Apples")
   - A **Send to** field showing the person who will receive the request
   - A **Comment** field where you can add a message to the recipient (e.g., "Please provide the necessary files for this agenda item.")
6. Click **Send request** to send the notification
7. A confirmation message will appear, letting you know the request was successfully sent

<Tip>
  The **Request files** modal includes a **Back** button that takes you back to the **Edit agenda item** modal, so you can easily return to editing without losing your place.

### What the recipient sees

The person you send the request to will receive an email notification (and optionally a text message) with a secure link. Through this link, they can:

- View the agenda item details
- Upload files and documents
- Add edits to the agenda item

Any files they upload will automatically appear as attachments on the agenda item.

### Upload files directly

If you already have the files you need, you can upload them directly to an agenda item:

1. Open the **Edit agenda item** modal
2. In the **Attachments** section, click **Upload file**
3. Select the file from your computer
4. The file will be attached to the agenda item
