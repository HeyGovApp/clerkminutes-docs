Agendas, minutes and recordings are all tied to a meeting. To start with ClerkMinutes, first you need to create a meeting.

Head over to [ClerkMinutes dashboard](https://app.heygov.com/account/login?redirect=%2F%3Ajurisdiction%2Fmeetings&for=clerkminutes), then click the **Add meeting** button. This page will open up:

There are 2 ways to fill in the details of a meeting:

### Manually

Fill the minimum of required fields, Title, Date & Start time, then click the **Create meeting** button.

### From an existing agenda

If you already have a meeting agenda as a PDF or DOCX document, you can upload or drop it in the **Upload or drop agenda** section.

ClerkMinutes will read and extract all meeting details. After you review the details, click the **Create meeting** button.

<Tip>
  **Agenda import shortcut:** You can simply drop a meeting agenda (PDF or DOCX) in the meetings list page. ClerkMinutes will read the agenda, create the meeting and import the agenda items in one go.
