Agendas, minutes and recordings are all tied to a meeting. To start with ClerkMinutes, first you need to create a meeting.

There are 2 ways to create a meeting:

## From scratch

1. Head over to ClerkMinutes in HeyGov, then click the **Add meeting** button

1. Fill the minimum of required fields, Title & Date, then click the **Create meeting** button

## From an existing agenda

If you already have a meeting agenda as a PDF document, you can create a meeting in ClerkMinutes by dragging and dropping the file anywhere on the ClerkMinutes or Meetings page.

The page can be empty or contain a list of existing meetings, either way is fine.

As you drag your meeting agenda over the page, the page will show a message awaiting you to drop the agenda.

HeyGov will extract meeting details from the agenda you provided, and meeting will be created.

After you created the agenda with either method, open the meeting page to view or edit more details.
